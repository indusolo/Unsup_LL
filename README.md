Unsupervised Lifelong Learning
#### U-TELL: UNSUPERVISED TASK EXPERT LIFELONG LEARNING - 
- U-TELL model is evaluated in an unsupervised setting for Class-IL and Domain-IL frameworks for six prominent continual learning datasets namely split MNIST (SMNIST), split CIFAR (SCIFAR), split SVHN (SSVHN), split WAFER (SWAFER) defect, rotated MNIST (RMNIST), and permuted MNIST (PMNIST). 
- The Class-IL setting for SMNIST, SCIFAR, SSVHN, SWAFER datasets is with five tasks $(t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5)$, where each task has two mutually exclusive classes {{0,1}, {2,3}, {4,5}, {6,7}, {8,9}}.
- SMNIST, SCIFAR10, and SSVHN with a training set of 10000 samples per task and a test set of 1000 samples per task and SWAFER dataset with training and testing sets of 1700 and 200 samples per task .
- The Domain-IL setting with RMNIST and PMNIST datasets is with four task sequences $(t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4$) with a training set of 15000 samples per task and a test set of 1250 samples per task.
- PMNIST dataset is generated by giving a distribution drift through random permutations to the original MNIST dataset.
- RMNIST dataset is created by random rotations of $\{[0-30],[31-60], [61-90], [91-120]\}$ degrees to the original MNIST dataset
